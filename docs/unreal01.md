# Geographic Simulation with Unreal Engine and Cesium

Unreal Engine is a game engine intended for designing and programming computer games in a three-dimensional environment. Because it provides a live and interactive 3d simulation, it gained popularity with the entertainment and architecture industries and more.

We will use Unreal Engine, together with a plugin called _Cesium_ to create a geographic simulation of Be'er Sheva, where we will store our 3d model library.

```
Install Unreal Engine from [https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download].
```

Installing Unreal Engine is a multi-step process. The downloaded file will install the **Epic Games Launcher**, which you'll use to install and manage your Unreal Engine installation. Under the Library tab, you can install the latest version of Unreal Engine.

```
While Unreal Engine is installed - go ahead and open an account at [Cesium].

After you're done installing the engine, navigate to the Marketplace tab to install the Cesium plugin. Search for **Cesium for Unreal**, and complete its installation. After everything is installed, click the **Launch** button on the upper right corner to start the engine. You'll be prompted to open a new project and select a template for it. Select the **game** category and a **blank** template.
