# Geographic Simulation with Unreal Engine and Cesium

Unreal Engine is a game engine intended for designing and programming computer games in a three-dimensional environment. Because it provides a live and interactive 3d simulation, it gained popularity with the entertainment and architecture industries and more.

We will use Unreal Engine, together with a plugin called _Cesium_ to create a geographic simulation of Be'er Sheva, where we will store our 3d model library.
