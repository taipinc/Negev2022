When studied closely, photographs provide much more information about the context of the photographic moment, and on the intentions and subjectivity of the photographer. Computational photography \u2013 the processing of photographs as digital information \u2013 allows us to step outside of the photographic moment and context, t eliminate subjectivity (or at least try to), and to study photographs as architectural documents and as forensic evidence.</p> <p>In this 3-day workshop, students will experiment with computational and photographic techniques to study and represent sites and places. Working in groups, students will work on a specific site and examine it using GIS mapping software, photogrammetry, programming, drone photography, archival and municipal information, 3d photographic reconstruction, and machine learning.</p> <p>Out of the many tools you will be introduced to during this workshop, each student will pick one or two to further develop and experiment with. The purpose of this workshop is to encourage you to explore new forms and mediums for the production of spatial knowledge.</p>"},{"location":"photogr/","title":"Workshop: Photogrammetry","text":"<p>When taking pictures for a photogrammetry model, it is always better to capture with a professional camera (the bigger the better), using RAW format, and to post-process the images on your computer. If you don\u2019t know what RAW format is, then just capture with whatever you\u2019re used to.</p>"},{"location":"photogr/#capturing-an-object","title":"Capturing an Object","text":"<p>Circulate around the object, taking pictures from multiple sides. You should capture from various heights, creating a sort of \u201cdome\u201d on top and around the object. Each picture should capture the entire object, but you could also take additional close-up pictures to get better details.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"photogr/#capturing-a-facade","title":"Capturing a Facade","text":"<p>For a facade, you want to have a few images of each detail from several positions. To that end, you can simply walk along the facade, and capture images in 3 directions. Make sure you have a lot of overlap between the images.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"photogr/#capturing-an-interior","title":"Capturing an Interior","text":"<p>Go around the room, with your back to the wall, and capture images of the walls that are opposite from you. You may want to take the images in portrait orientation so that a single image would capture from the ceiling to the floor. You may need to take a few images of the middle of the floor and ceiling from time to time, to make sure they are covered in your images.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"photogr/#interior-multiple-rooms","title":"Interior \u2013 Multiple Rooms","text":"<p>If you want your model to connect several rooms, you need to have a buffer between them that is sufficiently covered by images, so that the computer knows how to connect them. If there\u2019s no opening between the two rooms, there\u2019s no way to connect them automatically.</p> <p>Capture the two rooms as any other single interior room. Then capture the doorway or opening between them, as if it was an object \u2013 meaning, from many different sides.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"photogr/#processing","title":"Processing","text":"<p>There\u2019s a few photogrammetry software available with different pros and cons:</p> <ul> <li>RealityCapture \u2013 the best available software.

Available only for Windows PC, with Nvidia graphic cards.   Metashape \u2013 available for both Windows and Mac. You\u2019ll need to buy a copy, but a discounted educational version is available.</li> <li>3DF Zephyr Free \u2013 another free version, only available for Windows.
